buffering:

qtonpbuf period buffering for tone # old countdown discarded immediately, toggle not reset
         does toggle flip on period change
qnoipbuf period buffering for noise # new period applied after current countdown
qenvpbuf period buffering for env
         mixer off buffering for tone
         mixer off buffering for noise
qenvrbuf envelope reset buffering # reset does not wait until end of current step
         fixed level change buffering

edge values:

qtonpzer effect of period 0 on tone # result is average amp, assume same as 1
qnoispec effect of period 0 on noise # visually identical to 1 in time domain
qenvpzer effect of period 0 on envelope # spectrum confirms same as 1

calibration:

         fixed level to amp mapping
         variable level to amp mapping
qanlgmix analog mix function
         tone initial value
         noise initial value

algos:

qnoispec noise period spectrum # notches at formula frequency and multiples
qnoispec confirm noise lfsr
qanlgmix mixer off with fixed level # you get the level
qenvpbuf mixer off with variable level # you get the level
qbmixenv binary mixing function effect on env # mostly silence

resets:

         mixer on reset for tone
         mixer on reset for noise
