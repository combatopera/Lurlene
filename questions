buffering:

qtonpbuf period buffering for tone # old countdown discarded immediately, toggle not reset
         does toggle flip on period change
qnoipbuf period buffering for noise # new period applied after current countdown
qenvpbuf period buffering for env
         mixer off buffering for tone
         mixer off buffering for noise
qenvrbuf envelope reset buffering
         fixed level change buffering

edge values:

qtonpzer effect of period 0 on tone # result is average amp, assume same as 1
qnoispec effect of period 0 on noise # visually identical to 1 in time domain
qenvpzer effect of period 0 on envelope # spectrum confirms same as 1

calibration:

         fixed level to amp mapping
         variable level to amp mapping
qanlgmix analog mix function
         tone initial value
         noise initial value

algos:

qnoispec noise period spectrum # notches at formula frequency and multiples
qnoispec confirm noise lfsr
qanlgmix mixer off with fixed level
qenvpbuf mixer off with variable level
qbmixenv binary mixing function effect on env

resets:

         mixer on reset for tone
         mixer on reset for noise
